I am Amardeep and I love maths, coding and Machine Learning. I am pursuing MS in CS + AI at [NYU - Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/).

I work at the intersection of AI research and engineering challenges. Currently, my interests lie in tackling reasoning, alignment, and hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) across various fields, such as Visual question-answering, spatio-temporal reasoning, code-switching languages, and multi-modality. Although I specialize in NLP, I consider myself an AI nomad, captivated by any impactful and fascinating AI problem.

One day, I want to start a profitable and calm business solving niche AI research problems.


Outside of my professional interests, I am an adrenaline junkie who loves adventure sports. In my free time, I enjoy running 5K races, trekking, hiking, and binge-watching Netflix or anime.
