I am pursuing Masters in Computer Science from New York University (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences). Priorly, as a software engineer with a focus on natural language processing and deep learning, I have a strong interest in large-language-models, keyphrase extraction and generation, code-switching, dialogue summarization, and multilingual language models. In addition to my professional pursuits, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and conducting independent research in the field of NLP in my free time.
