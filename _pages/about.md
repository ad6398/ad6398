I am Amardeep and I love maths, coding and Machine Learning. One day, I hope to start a successful, calm business with a small, close-knit team, solving niche AI research problems.

I work at the intersection of AI research and engineering challenges. Currently, my interests lie in tackling reasoning, alignment, and hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) across various fields, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, code-switching languages, and multi-modality. Although I specialize in NLP, I consider myself an AI nomad, captivated by any impactful and fascinating AI problem.

## Brief history

I was born and raised in India. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at IIT Dhanbad in 2020. After that, I worked for three years as an ML engineer at Instabase and Walmart. Now, I'm pursuing an MS in Computer Science with a specialization in AI at NYU Courant. I'm also an adrenaline junkie who loves adventure sports.
