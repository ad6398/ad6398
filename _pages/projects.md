# Projects

1. [**Conditional Diffusion Model for Next Frame Generation**](https://github.com/ad6398/Conditional-Diffusion-Model-for-Next-Frame-Generation)
   
   A diffusion model conditioned on past 11 frames for auto-regressive generation of next 11 frames. Achieved an MSE of 0.004 for next frame prediction and Jaccard score of 30.89 for semantic segmentation.

2. [**transformerkp:** A transformers based library for keyphrase identification from text documents.](https://github.com/Deep-Learning-for-Keyphrase/transformerkp)
   
   transformerkp allows you to train and apply state-of-the-art deep learning models for keyphrase extraction and generation from text documents. It supports several benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics for keyphrase extraction and generation.

3. [**t-CRF:** CRF head on top of Transformer for sequence tagging.](https://github.com/ad6398/t-crf)
   
   t-CRF enables users to use Conditional Random Field layer on top of any Transformer based sequence tagger like POS tagger, entity recognition, etc.

4. [**SpanElectra:** A language model with accuracy of spanBERT and efficiency of ELECTRA.](https://github.com/ad6398/SpanElectra)
   
   SpanElectra is an efficient language model that uses span boundary objective from SpanBert LM to capture span-level context but uses the discriminator-generator training method inspired by Electra LM for efficient low-resource training.

5. [**Question-Generation using Language Model.**](https://github.com/ad6398/Question-Generation)
   
   Given a paragraph, generate all the possible questions related to this paragraph. If a context is provided, create those questions from that paragraph whose answer should be that context.
