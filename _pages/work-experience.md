# Work Experience

## Software Engineer, Machine Learning at *Instabase*
**January 2022 - August 2023**

- Designed and implemented a model inference service, regression and load-testing framework to integrate Large-Language-Models and Generative AI capabilities into Instabase’s platform.
- Devised a model drift detection pipeline using layout change detectors to detect format drift and employed Least-Squares Density Difference and Maximum Mean Discrepancies on document embeddings to catch content drift in documents.
- Designed and implemented the async Model service, which combined async workers, RabbitMQ, two levels of caching, and sticky routing techniques to improve inference time by 40% on a compute-limited Kubernetes environment.

## Software Engineer II at *Walmart Global Tech India*
**August 2020 — December 2021**

- Implemented the entity embedding technique for sparse categorical values, improving the accuracy of existing forecasting systems by 17% and reducing inference time by 15%. This also minimized the effort required for feature engineering.
- Enhanced the gradient boosting algorithm to incorporate feedback from distribution center managers while calculating errors to form decision trees. Implemented weighted loss to penalize misclassifications of perishable items, such as fruits and dairy products, more heavily.

## Google Summer of Code, Developer at *AOSSIE Org.*
**May 2019 – August 2019**

- Developed a Google Chrome extension utilizing natural language processing (NLP) to detect toxic comments, clickbait, and fake news on news websites and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
- Trained a stance detection model for fake news classification and implemented a backend service using Flask for model inference. Designed a three-level cache system to optimize latency and avoid duplicate inference requests.

## Applied Research Intern at *Genesys*
**May 2019 – July 2019**

- Implemented a passage ranking algorithm to boost the accuracy of the in-house Question and Answer services’ model on client datasets.
- Created a framework to train AllenNLP’s machine reading comprehension models on in-house medical data as part of a client’s proof of concept (POC) and proposed its integration with the homegrown Chat Bot.
