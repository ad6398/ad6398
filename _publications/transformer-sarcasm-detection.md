Sarcasm Detection with Context, a shared task
of Second Workshop on Figurative Language
Processing (co-located with ACL 2020), is
study of effect of context on Sarcasm detection
in conversations of Social media. We present
different techniques and models, mostly based
on transformer for Sarcasm Detection with
Context. We extended latest pre-trained transformers like BERT, RoBERTa, spanBERT on
different task objectives like single sentence
classification, sentence pair classification, etc.
to understand role of conversation context for
sarcasm detection on Twitter conversations
and conversation threads from Reddit. We
also present our own architecture consisting of
LSTM and Transformers to achieve the objective.
