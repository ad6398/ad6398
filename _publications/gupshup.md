Code-switching is the communication phenomenon where the speakers switch between different languages during a conversation. With the widespread adoption of conversational agents and chat platforms, codeswitching has become an integral part of written conversations in many multi-lingual communities worldwide. Therefore, it is essential
to develop techniques for understanding and
summarizing these conversations. Towards
this objective, we introduce the task of abstractive summarization of Hindi-English (HiEn) code-switched conversations. We also
develop the first code-switched conversation
summarization dataset - GupShup, which contains over 6,800 Hi-En conversations and their
corresponding human-annotated summaries in
English (En) and Hi-En. We present a detailed account of the entire data collection and
annotation process. We analyze the dataset
using various code-switching statistics. We
train state-of-the-art abstractive summarization models and report their performances using both automated metrics and human evaluation. Our results show that multi-lingual
mBART and multi-view seq2seq models obtain the best performances on this new dataset.
We also conduct an extensive qualitative analysis to provide insight into the models and some
of their shortcomings.
